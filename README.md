# desafio_spike_energia
This repository contains a Machine Learning project to apply to a Data Scientist position at Spike. Still don't know if it's correct, and it possibly isn't because it's my first time dealing with timeseries data. If you have any suggestions, I would be very happy to read them.

## Description
There is a Jupyter Notebook containing the script. The analysis and comments are in spanish. There is also the html version of the Jupyter Notebook. The data was too heavy and GitHub did not allow the upload, but feel free to contact me if you want to me to send it to you by other means.
